1. What is virtual table and virtual pointer.
Why in 
class Derived4 : virtual public Empty
{
    int a;
};

16 bytes? 


2. How behave generated assignment operator when we have string& member in class?

3. Compliler will not generate assingment operator in derived class if it's declared in base class as private assignment operator. Test it.

4. Generated by compiler assignment operators for derived classes must process parts of base classes( rule 12). but during process, of course, that can't call class methods to which access is forbidden.
